Examples of your code can only be taken from the lab assignments or the projects; i.e., not from check-ins or practice activities. On Canvas you can find a detailed description of the major and minor learning goals, how you can demonstrate your proficiency, and what is required for particular course grades.\nNote that the portfolio is not simply a list of links to your code; it also requires a brief discussion of how that code demonstrates the skill. There are also general reflection and summary questions involved. That is to say, although you will not necessarily need to write code, the portfolio will take a good amount of time and effort to assemble; plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiness a GitHub Workflow Early On\n\n\n\nSince portfolio items consist of links to specific pull requests on GitHub, it is critically important that you get into a good GitHub workflow early in the class.\nYou should be committing changes regularly, with informative commit messages. Think of this as a “save” action; you want to commit every time you make a small but substantive change to your code.\nYou should be pull requesting changes whenever you finish a major step in a project; for example, if you complete a specific data analysis or add a function to a package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental Progress\n\n\n\nYou can do your future self a big favor by working on your portfolio progressively throughout the quarter, instead of leaving it all for Finals Week. My suggestion is that each week, you add everything you can to your portfolio that you demonstrated in that week."

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others’ opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."
