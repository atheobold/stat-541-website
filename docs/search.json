In this case, map() (which returns a list) is the best option because some variables have multiple classes:\n\nmap(diamonds, class)\n\n$carat\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$cut\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n\n$color\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n\n$clarity\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n\n$depth\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$table\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$price\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n$x\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$y\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$z\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nThe error we encountered with map_chr() is a nice feature of purrr because it allows us to be very sure of the type of output we are getting. Failing loudly is vastly preferable to getting unexpected outputs silently because we can catch errors earlier!\nWe can combine map_*() functions with tidy selection for some powerful variable summaries that require much less code than for() loops.\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% \n  select(where(is.numeric)) %&gt;% \n  map_dbl(.f = mean)\n\n       carat        depth        table        price            x            y \n   0.7979397   61.7494049   57.4571839 3932.7997219    5.7311572    5.7345260 \n           z \n   3.5387338 \n\ndiamonds %&gt;% \n  select(!where(is.numeric)) %&gt;% \n  map_int(.f = n_distinct)\n\n    cut   color clarity \n      5       7       8 \n\n\n\nExercises\n\nWrite a function called summ_stats() that takes a numeric vector x as input and returns the mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR as a data frame.

If you absolutely must iterate over a process, rely on the map() or apply() function families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy choose map() instead of apply()?\n\n\n\nThe map() and apply() functions will typically be close to the same speed, so the largest argument in favor of the map() family of functions are (1) their consistent syntax, and (2) their consistent object output.\nThe map() function always returns a list and the map_XXX() variants always return a vector of a specified data type. Whereas, apply() returns a vector or a list, lapply() returns a list, and sapply() returns a vetor or a matrix.\n\n\nHere is a motivating example demonstrating the difference in run time between a function which loops over every column in a data frame to extract the data type and a function which uses map_chr() to apply the class() function to every column of a data frame:\n\nloop_func &lt;- function(df){\n  \n  # initialize the type object\n  type &lt;- rep(NA, ncol(df))\n  \n  for(i in 1:ncol(df)){\n    \n    # store the class of the ith column of df into the ith entry of type \n    type[i] &lt;- class(df[,i])\n  }\n  \n  return(type)\n}\n\nmap_func &lt;- function(df){\n  \n  type &lt;- map_chr(df, class)\n  \n  return(type)\n\n  }\n\ndat &lt;- as.data.frame(\n  matrix(1,\n         nrow = 5,\n         ncol = 100000)\n  )\n\nmicrobenchmark::microbenchmark(loop_func(dat),\n                               map_func(dat),\n                               times = 3)\n\nUnit: milliseconds\n           expr  min   lq mean median   uq  max neval\n loop_func(dat) 6586 6594 6602   6602 6610 6618     3\n  map_func(dat)   36   36   36     36   36   36     3\n\n\nThat‚Äôs a pretty big difference!",

    "text": "In this second unit, we will dig deeper into the ideas surrounding efficiency. We will start with a review of writing functions in R‚Äîcreating both vector and data frame functions and learning how to write functions which incorporate ‚Äútidy evaluation.‚Äù Next, we will take these functions to the next step by considering the efficiency of the function‚Äîhow many intermediate objects are created, what order are operations run, what functions are used internally? Alongside these considerations, we will also compare and contrast different methods for iterating over functions‚Äîfor loops and the purrr family of functions. From the perspective of efficiency, we will consider why one would choose one tool over the other.\nAfter this review of efficiency, we will put our function writing an iteration to work! First we will explore hierarchical (JSON) data, iterating over multiple calls to an API. Next, we will explore extracting (scraping) data from a webpage, iterating over multiple webpages. Finally, we will use iteration to generate art from code.",

This kind of impersonation will result in a permanent ban from the server.)\n\n\nDecide about privacy and notifications\nThe default settings on the channel are probably just fine for you. Feel free to make any changes that work for you, though.\nYou can change your message notifications:\n\nYou can edit your privacy settings, although most things are already private:\n\n\n\nConnect other apps\nYou can connect other apps to Discord, either for productivity or just for fun.\n\nDr.¬†Bodwin has connected her Spotify, so you can listen along with her music and/or judge her taste.",

Make sure you are careful about when you are muted or unmuted.\n\nThe extra ‚ÄúSide Chat‚Äù channels are limited to 4 or 8 people, if you would like to start an impromptu study conversation without being heard by the professors and/or the rest of the class. (We‚Äôll only drop in if you invite us!)\nVoice channels can also be used for people to ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù, and share their screen with everyone else.\n\nWhile this will usually be something professors use to demonstrate code, you can go live, too! But you may need to download the desktop version of Discord to do so.\n\n\nPrivate messages\nIt is also easy to send private messages, to your professor(s) or to each other. These private messages can also easily be used to launch a private video chat and/or screen sharing.",

If you are less familiar with these packages or it‚Äôs been some time since you used them, I would strongly recommend referencing the function documentation!\nFor these problems, we will continue to work with the mpg data frame, making various changes to the data to clean it up.\n\nThe fl variable describes the type of fuel for each car, with levels: p, r, e, d, and c. Do some research into what each of these labels mean! Then, use the if_else() function to create a new variable (fuel_type) with two levels: petrol (any car using petrolium-based gas) and alternative energy (any car not using petrolium-based gas).\n\n\nThe drv variable describes if the car has front drive (f), rear drive (r), or four wheel drive (4). Let‚Äôs make better labels for these values! Specifically, use the case_when() function to change the drv variable to have the following levels: front, rear, four wheel.\n\n\nThe trans variable contains two pieces of information, (1) the transmission style (auto or manual) and the specific type of transmission (e.g., l5, m5). Using the separate_wider_delim() function, create two new variables from trans, (1) trans_type containing the specific type of transmission of each car (e.g., l5), and (2) trans_style the style of the transmission (e.g., auto).

Examples of your code can only be taken from the lab assignments or the projects; i.e., not from check-ins or practice activities. On Canvas you can find a detailed description of the major and minor learning goals, how you can demonstrate your proficiency, and what is required for particular course grades.\nNote that the portfolio is not simply a list of links to your code; it also requires a brief discussion of how that code demonstrates the skill. There are also general reflection and summary questions involved. That is to say, although you will not necessarily need to write code, the portfolio will take a good amount of time and effort to assemble; plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental Progress\n\n\n\nYou can do your future self a big favor by working on your portfolio progressively throughout the quarter, instead of leaving it all for Finals Week. My suggestion is that each week, you add everything you can to your portfolio that you demonstrated in that week."

If you are registered with DRC to have deadline extensions, you are required to complete a deadline extension request and make a note if your extension is related to a need related to DRC accommodations.\nAny late work is required to have a deadline extension request, meaning if you do not complete a deadline extension request for an assignment you are not permitted to turn it in late.

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others‚Äô opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

    "text": "Final Grade Reflection\nThis component is a self-evaluation of your performance in the class. Your goal is to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade. Please be thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.\nThis reflection will be done in the reflection-template.qmd file. The structure of the document is as follows:\n\nFor each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.\n\n\nYou must indicate where the code you provided came from, linking to the blog post from your personal website.\n\n\nWhat grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.\nHow did you meet that grade‚Äôs requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the Portfolio Rubric. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you‚Äôve earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you‚Äôve met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.\nWhat else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn‚Äôt explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you‚Äôre thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough ‚Äî and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.\n\nPlus/minus grades: You may argue to add a ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äù modifier to your grade. Generally speaking a ‚Äú+‚Äù added to a letter grade means you‚Äôve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a ‚Äú-‚Äù means that you have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare minimum, or you‚Äôve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small number of minor criteria.",

So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, I respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class.\nWhen making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of your investment of time and effort. Did your efforts result in several exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made you a valuable group member.",

    "section": "Questions You Might Have",
    "text": "Questions You Might Have\n\nQ: What if you disagree with our final grade reflection?\n\nA: There are two ways this might happen.\n\nYou ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports. That is, you grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you‚Äôve provided supports this grade. If this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting.I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this feedback when constructing your final portfolio. If I believe the grade you‚Äôve proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you‚Äôve provided, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting. I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your grade request is correct, you‚Äôll have the chance to walk me through your materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the evidence supports. I have faith that we‚Äôll be able to come to a mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can‚Äôt, I will assign the grade that in my estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply overriding your grade determination.\nYou ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. That is, you ‚Äúlowball‚Äù yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you earned, and then just inform you that I‚Äôve done so (and why).\n\nIn my experience, the second situation happens significantly more frequently than the first.\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a limit on the number of artifacts I can include to support my grade?\n\nA: There is no strict limit, but please be selective.\nQuality, not quantity is what we are after. We do not want every assignment in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in fewer than 8 assignments with judicious selection of homework solutions and other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a massive binder of mediocre examples.\n\n\n\nQ: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone‚Äôs question on Discord?\n\nA: This isn‚Äôt filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn‚Äôt necessary.\nDetails and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness here. For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord, pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you say? Why was that comment an example of ‚Äúhelpful feedback‚Äù? (Do you know that it was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you‚Äôve earned a particular grade.\n\n\n\nQ: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a ‚ÄúD‚Äù in the class?\n\nA: Yes, if the person is honest and there‚Äôs not enough evidence to make the case for a ‚ÄúC‚Äù.\nIf you‚Äôre in that situation, be honest and don‚Äôt overreach just because the consequences are significant.\n\n\n\nQ: How long should the essays be?\n\nA: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses ‚Äî without going overboard and writing more than you need.\nThere is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.\n\n\n\nQ: What if you do not submit a Final Portfolio?\n\nA: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion.\nI will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.\nI‚Äôll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up.",

This week, we‚Äôre going to add interactive content to our dashboards!\nThis week is different from the previous weeks in that you get to choose which tool you want to explore when creating interactive content on your dashboard. There are two options:\n\nShiny\nQuarto Live (webR and Observable JavaScript)\n\nEither tool will allow you to make interactive content, but the way that you go about making the content differs (pretty substantially). Since you may not have heard about or explored either of these tools I would strongly recommend poking around the resources below before making your decision!\n\nMaking Interactive Content with Shiny\nQuick vignette: https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html\nExample Shiny dashboard: https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/penguins-dashboard/\n\n\nMaking Interactive Content with webR (and OJS)\nQuick vignette: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/10/quarto-live-0-1-1/\nFull Quarto Live documentation: https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/\nExample webR dashboard: https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/interactive/dashboards.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncompatible format options\n\n\n\nQuarto live requires you to use format: live-html which differs from the live-dashboard format you used last week. So, if you want to integrate webR into your dashboard from last week, you will need to rethink how to migrate your dashboard into an HTML file.",

This exploration parallels the worldbank examples from the tidyjson vignette.\nStep 1 ‚Äì Use spread_all() to spread the values of a JSON object\n\nWhen you use the spread_all() function on the companies dataset, how many columns are created?\n\n\nStep 2 ‚Äì Find the values that were not able to be spread\nTo identify the names of an object, their type, and frequency we use the following pipeline:\n\nname_of_data %&gt;% \n  gather_object() %&gt;% \n  json_types() %&gt;% \n  count(name, type)\n\nThe gather_object() function collapses a JSON object into name-value pairs, producing a tbl_json object. The json_types() function then inspects the JSON associated with each row of the tbl_json object, and adds a new column (\"type\") that identifies the type according to the JSON standard. We can then count() the number of occurrences of each name, type combination to understand how many rows / observations contained these values.\n\nHow many different values are included in the companies dataset?\n\nNow that we know the name of every value in the companies dataset, we can inspect how many of these columns were not captured when we used spread-all().\n\nHow many arrays from the companies dataset were not spread into new columns?\n\nStep 3 ‚Äì Manually spread the problem values\nNow that we know the names of the values that were not spread into columns, we can wrangle specific values to capture their values. Let‚Äôs do this with the acquisitions value.\nWe do this with the following pipeline:\n\nname_of_dataset %&gt;% \n  enter_object(name_of_value) %&gt;% \n  gather_array() %&gt;% \n  spread_all()\n\nThe enter_object() function allows you to navigate a specific value of the JSON data by referencing its name. gather_array() then collapses a JSON array into index-value pairs, creating a new column array.index to store the index of the array, and storing values in the ‚ÄòJSON‚Äô attribute for further tidyjson manipulation.\n\nUsing this pipeline on the acquisitions array of the companies dataset, what values are stored in this array? i.e., what are the names of the new columns that appear in the spread dataset?\n\nStep 4 ‚Äì Combining everything together\nBy combining with our initial top-level spread_all(), we can aggregate the sale price of companies by category_code and the currency it was sold in.\n\n# For nice looking tables!\nlibrary(gt)\n\ncompanies %&gt;% \n  spread_all() %&gt;% \n  # Manually extracting information from acquisitions\n  enter_object(acquisitions) %&gt;% \n  gather_array() %&gt;% \n  spread_all() %&gt;% \n  # Removing missing values from relevant variables\n  drop_na(category_code, price_currency_code, price_amount) %&gt;% \n  # Finding max sale price for different company categories\n  group_by(category_code, price_currency_code) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    max_price = max(price_amount), \n    .groups = \"drop\"\n            ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    # Convert to dollar format\n    max_price = scales::dollar(max_price), \n    # Remove _ from company sector\n    category_code = str_replace_all(category_code, \n                                    pattern = \"_\",\n                                    replacement = \" \"), \n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word\n    category_code = str_to_title(category_code)\n    ) %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;% \n  cols_label(category_code = md(\"**Business Sector**\"), \n                 price_currency_code = md(\"**Currency of Sale**\"), \n                 max_price = md(\"**Max Company Sale Price**\")\n                 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Sector\nCurrency of Sale\nMax Company Sale Price\n\n\n\n\nBiotech\nUSD\n$587,000,000\n\n\nConsulting\nUSD\n$4,500,000\n\n\nEnterprise\nUSD\n$4,900,000,000\n\n\nHardware\nUSD\n$710,000,000\n\n\nMobile\nUSD\n$168,000,000\n\n\nNetwork Hosting\nUSD\n$45,340,000\n\n\nNews\nUSD\n$1,850,000,000\n\n\nOther\nUSD\n$23,700,000\n\n\nPublic Relations\nUSD\n$25,000,000\n\n\nSearch\nUSD\n$225,000,000\n\n\nSecurity\nUSD\n$242,000,000\n\n\nSemiconductor\nUSD\n$342,500,000\n\n\nSoftware\nUSD\n$155,000,000\n\n\nWeb\nUSD\n$260,000,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 ‚Äì Scaling to multiple columns\nThis is a powerful process, but you might be able to see how we don‚Äôt necessarily want to do this process repeatedly for every value spread_all() was not able to parse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see a way you could use iteration to complete this task?",

For example, on the NIH News Releases page, we can see that the data is represented in a consistent pattern of image + title + abstract.\nWe will identify data in a web page using a pattern matching language called CSS Selectors that can refer to specific patterns in HTML, the language used to write web pages.\nFor example:\n\nSelecting by tag:\n\n\"a\" selects all hyperlinks in a webpage (‚Äúa‚Äù represents ‚Äúanchor‚Äù links in HTML)\n\"p\" selects all paragraph elements\n\nSelecting by ID and class:\n\n\".description\" selects all elements with class equal to ‚Äúdescription‚Äù\n\nThe . at the beginning is what signifies class selection.\nThis is one of the most common CSS selectors for scraping because in HTML, the class attribute is extremely commonly used to format webpage elements. (Any number of HTML elements can have the same class, which is not true for the id attribute.)\n\n\"#mainTitle\" selects the SINGLE element with id equal to ‚ÄúmainTitle‚Äù\n\nThe # at the beginning is what signifies id selection.\n\n\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWebsites change often! So if you are going to scrape a lot of data, it is probably worthwhile to save and date a copy of the website. Otherwise, you may return after some time and your scraping code will include all of the wrong CSS selectors.\n\n\nAlthough you can learn how to use CSS Selectors by hand, we will use a shortcut by installing the Selector Gadget tool.\n\nThere is a version available for Chrome‚Äìadd it to Chrome via the Chome Web Store.\n\nMake sure to pin the extension to the menu bar.

We would need to call the function to scrape a page once for each page we want to scrape.",
