On Canvas you can find a detailed description of the major and minor learning goals, how you can demonstrate your proficiency, and what is required for particular course grades.\nNote that the portfolio is not simply a list of links to your code; it also requires a brief discussion of how that code demonstrates the skill.

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others‚Äô opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

You are also encouraged (realistically, required!) to make use of online resources to accomplish tasks.\nWhen dealing with code, follow these guidelines:\n\nNever copy-paste more than small snippets of code. That is, you might borrow a little three-line function from StackOverflow, but you should not copy over a full analysis you find on Kaggle.\nAttribute all code that is not completely your own. If you do borrow that StackOverflow snippet, provide a link to the source. If you reference a similar analysis for ideas, mention that in your description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain Your Code\n\n\n\nA good rule for deciding if the code you are borrowing is plagiarism is: If I sat you down by yourself in a room with no internet, could you explain to me roughly what each line of code is doing?\n(In fact, this is exactly what I will do if I need to investigate possible cheating.)"

That is, you should save the ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with the chatbot, to show how you used your knowledge of R coding to construct queries that lead to useful results.\nWhen you submit your portfolio, if you use AI-generated code in your examples, you will need to make an argument for how you are demonstrating mastery of the requisite skills, and the AI is only being used as support."
