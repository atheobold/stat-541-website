In this class, we will exclusively make use of tools from the tidyverse suite of packages to perform our data cleaning and wrangling operations. If you are less familiar with these packages or it’s been some time since you used them, I would strongly recommend referencing the function documentation!\nFor these problems, we will continue to work with the mpg data frame, making various changes to the data to clean it up.\n\nThe fl variable describes the type of fuel for each car, with levels: p, r, e, d, and c. Do some research into what each of these labels mean! Then, use the if_else() function to create a new variable (fuel_type) with two levels: petrol (any car using petrolium-based gas) and alternative energy (any car not using petrolium-based gas).\n\n\nThe drv variable describes if the car has front drive (f), rear drive (r), or four wheel drive (4). Let’s make better labels for these values! Specifically, use the case_when() function to change the drv variable to have the following levels: front, rear, four wheel.\n\n\nThe trans variable contains two pieces of information, (1) the transmission style (auto or manual) and the specific type of transmission (e.g., l5, m5). Using the separate_wider_delim() function, create two new variables from trans, (1) trans_type containing the specific type of transmission of each car (e.g., l5), and (2) trans_style the style of the transmission (e.g., auto).

In your portfolio, you will give a curated collection of your best work along with reflections that tell the story of your growth from the first day of classes all the way to the end. Your goal is to argue, convincingly and with concrete evidence, that you have met the criteria for both content proficiency, evidence of continued learning, and growth as a team member that goes with a particular grade.

    "text": "Final Grade Reflection\nThis component is a self-evaluation of your performance in the class. Your goal is to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade. Please be thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.\nThis reflection will be done in the reflection_template.qmd file. The structure of the document is as follows:\n\nFor each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.\n\n\nYou must indicate where the code you provided came from, linking to the blog post from your personal website.\n\n\nWhat grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.\nHow did you meet that grade’s requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the Portfolio Rubric. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you’ve earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you’ve met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.\nWhat else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn’t explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.\n\nPlus/minus grades: You may argue to add a “+” or “-” modifier to your grade. Generally speaking a “+” added to a letter grade means you’ve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a “-” means that you have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare minimum, or you’ve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small number of minor criteria.",

I want you to know that I see you, I respect your efforts, and it’s extremely fulfilling to see you respond to the challenges and grow.\nI also want to be clear that while the time and effort spent on the class are vitally important, they are not explicitly part of the grade criteria you find in the syllabus. So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, I respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class.\nWhen making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of your investment of time and effort. Did your efforts result in several exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made you a valuable group member.",

    "section": "Questions You Might Have",
    "text": "Questions You Might Have\n\nQ: What if you disagree with our final grade reflection?\n\nA: There are two ways this might happen.\n\nYou ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports. That is, you grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you’ve provided supports this grade. If this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting.I’ll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this feedback when constructing your final portfolio. If I believe the grade you’ve proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you’ve provided, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting. I’ll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your grade request is correct, you’ll have the chance to walk me through your materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the evidence supports. I have faith that we’ll be able to come to a mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can’t, I will assign the grade that in my estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply overriding your grade determination.\nYou ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. That is, you “lowball” yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you earned, and then just inform you that I’ve done so (and why).\n\nIn my experience, the second situation happens significantly more frequently than the first.\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a limit on the number of artifacts I can include to support my grade?\n\nA: There is no strict limit, but please be selective.\nQuality, not quantity is what we are after. We do not want every assignment in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in fewer than 8 assignments with judicious selection of homework solutions and other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a massive binder of mediocre examples.\n\n\n\nQ: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone’s question on Discord?\n\nA: This isn’t filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn’t necessary.\nDetails and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness here. For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord, pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you say? Why was that comment an example of “helpful feedback”? (Do you know that it was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you’ve earned a particular grade.\n\n\n\nQ: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a “D” in the class?\n\nA: Yes, if the person is honest and there’s not enough evidence to make the case for a “C”.\nIf you’re in that situation, be honest and don’t overreach just because the consequences are significant.\n\n\n\nQ: How long should the essays be?\n\nA: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses — without going overboard and writing more than you need.\nThere is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.\n\n\n\nQ: What if you do not submit a Final Portfolio?\n\nA: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion.\nI will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.\nI’ll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up.",

However, every student will be permitted to submit up to three individual assignments up to 3-days late, by completing a deadline extension form.

Your new deadline must be within 3-days of the original deadline.\nAll deadline extensions must be done through the form, so I can keep track of who has used their allotment of extensions. If you are registered with DRC to have deadline extensions, you are required to complete a deadline extension request and make a note if your extension is related to a need related to DRC accommodations.\nAny late work is required to have a deadline extension request, meaning if you do not complete a deadline extension request for an assignment you are not permitted to turn it in late. The link to the deadline extension form can be found in Canvas in the Course Information module (at the top of the page).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline extensions are not permitted for the Final Portfolio!"

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others’ opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

If you do borrow that StackOverflow snippet, provide a link to the source. If you reference a similar analysis for ideas, mention that in your description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain Your Code\n\n\n\nA good rule for deciding if the code you are borrowing is plagiarism is: If I sat you down by yourself in a room with no internet, could you explain to me roughly what each line of code is doing?\n(In fact, this is exactly what I will do if I need to investigate possible cheating.)"

We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of July 1, 2024 was R-4.4.1 (Race for Your Life).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).",
