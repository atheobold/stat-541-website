In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others’ opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using GitHub pages, describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use resume.github.io to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by starring the project page).\nThe development of Quarto has made it incredibly simple to generate websites, which can be easily hosted by GitHub Pages."

There are so many resources for creating Quarto websites, but my absolute favorite one’s are from Sam Shanny-Csik.\nFollow this step-by-step guide for creating a new Quarto website: &lt;https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName your project &lt;YourGitHubUsername&gt;.github.io\n\n\n\nWe’re going to deploy websites using GitHub pages, and it would be nice if your website had a professional name! I would recommend using your username, unless you chose a username that isn’t very descriptive or unique (e.g., brandonk04). If this is the case, I would recommend you use a more descriptive name for your project (e.g., brandon-kim-04).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI would strongly recommend this folder living inside your broader “STAT 541” folder, at least for now!"
