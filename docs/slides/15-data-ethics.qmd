# Land Acknowledgement

> Cal Poly sits on the land of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini,
Northern Chumash tribe. We acknowledge, respect, and thank the yak titʸu titʸu
yak tiłhini on whose **stolen land** we are guests. 

Indigenous people are not relics of the past. We who work and live here must
bear witness to the ongoing effects of colonization.

<!-- Land acknowledgements do not exist in a past tense, or historical context:  -->
<!-- colonialism is a current ongoing process, and we need to build our mindfulness -->
<!-- of our present participation. -->

# Data feminism?

## Data Neutrality

> Data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social
> relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical
> analysis.

Focuses beyond women and gender.

Focuses on the distribution of **power**.

# Discussion Questions

# Which actors in the data ecosystem are responsible for providing context? 

End users? Data publishers? Data intermediaries?

# What steps can we take to ensure context is considered? 

How can we more effectively present context through data visualization?

# What are your thoughts on how we label graphs with context?

## Elevating Emotion

> "We focus on four conventions which imbue visualizations with a sense of objectivity, transparency and facticity. These include: (a) two-dimensional viewpoints, (b) clean layouts, (c) geometric shapes and lines, (d) the inclusion of data sources."

> Kennedy et al. (2016)

missing altogether?

In the "Data Context" section of your Final Poster, you are required to
provide a description that directly addresses the: 

- social,
- cultural,
- historical,
- institutional, and 
- material conditions under which the data were produced. 

## Example: Ames, Iowa Housing Data

::: {.incremental}
- What are the social conditions of these data?

- What are the cultural conditions of these data?

- What are the historical conditions of these data?

- What are the institutional conditions of these data?

- What are the material conditions of these data?
