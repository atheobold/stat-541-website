# Discussion Questions

<!-- ## What is the significance of the title Weapons of Math Destruction? -->

# According to O’Neil, is every mathematical model a Weapon of Math Destruction? Why or why not?

# O'Neil characterizes some algorithms as "Weapons of Math Destruction." Who is the most vulnerable to being harmed by their use?

# Have you had experiences with algorithms that O’Neil’s account illuminates?

<!-- ## Is there a scale on which we believe we can replace the efficiency of -->
<!-- WMDs with the more expensive alternative?  -->

<!-- Are algorithms our only answer to tackling big data? -->

# What is (or what could be) the role of data scientists in data justice?

## Professional Ethics

![](images/16-ASA.png)

::: {.midi}
The American Statistical Association’s [Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/ethical-guidelines-for-statistical-practice) are intended to help statistics practitioners make decisions ethically.
Additionally, the ethical guidelines aim to promote accountability by informing
those who rely on statistical analysis of the standards they should expect.
:::

## Technical Responsibilities

> Ensuring analyses are valid.

. . .

- Checking assumptions (e.g. no regression when relationship isn't linear).
- Matching analyses to data types (e.g., no linear regression with 0/1 
response).

## Reproducibility and Documentation

> Being transparent about your process and its limitations.

. . .

- Reporting insignificant results, not just significant ones.
- Maintaining reproducibility and documenting all data processing.
- Being clear about the scope of the conclusions.
- Sharing your work openly when possible.

## Professional Responsibilities

> Performing analyses and communicating results in ways that are not misleading,
> even when you could get away with it.

. . .

- No p-hacking / gathering extra data until it’s significant.
- No switching your hypotheses after seeing the data (or running the analysis).
- No dropping NAs unless you can justify why. 

# Ethics

## Data Science Oath

::: {.midi}

> I will respect the privacy of my data subjects, for their data are not
> disclosed to me that the world may know, so I will tread with care in matters
> of privacy and security.

> I will remember that my data are not just numbers without meaning or context,
> but represent real people and situations, and that my work may lead to
> unintended societal consequences, such as inequality, poverty, and disparities
> due to algorithmic bias.

## Social Responsibilities

> Considering impact, harm, and power.


- Checking that the data collection process is not harmful (e.g. unethical
experiments, uncomfortable survey questions, omitting certain groups from the
study)
- Checking that the data cleaning process is not harmful (e.g. “othering”
groups)
- Considering how conclusions will be used (e.g. who funded the study, what
might they use it for, etc. - like crime prediction tools and such)

# Final Project

## Final Project Requirements

[This document describes the requirements of the Final Project](/project/project-requirements.qmd). 

Your Poster will have six total sections:

1. Introduction
2. Methods
3. Visualizations
4. Model
5. Results / Implications
6. Ethics & Limitations

## Ethics & Limitations

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Model Ethics**

How could your model detrimentally impact people? 
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
**Limitations**

What are the limitations of your models?
What are the limitations of the inferences that can be made from these data?
