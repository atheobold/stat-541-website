-   Class questions go on **DISCORD**

-   Use my email **only** for personal concerns that you want to talk about privately to me.

# Setup

## Colab Notebooks

-   In Data Science, everyone uses **Notebooks**, not scripts, for coding.

-   We will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** (invented at Cal Poly!), hosted for free by **Google Colab**.

-   If you want to work offline, you can install **Anaconda** on your laptop.

-   I recommend an IDE like **PyCharm** (or **Positron**) as well.

# The Brave New World of GenAI

## Academic Integrity

-   If you copy text from a website into your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you ask your friend to write your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you pay someone else to write your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you ask GenAI to do your work and then copy the answers, it's cheating.

## Conversation, not copying

It is okay (in fact, encouraged) to ...

-   Ask GenAI for tips on how to get started on a coding problem

-   Ask GenAI to help find bugs in your code

-   Ask GenAI to help explain concepts or functions

-   **Pretend ChatGPT is your human tutor or TA!**

## Activity: Good and bad use of AI

1.  Find your group member 

    * In the "People" tab on Canvas, find your "Day 1 Group"
    
2.  Once you have found your group member, open the Activity 1.1 notebook 
(linked on Canvas).

. . .

**15-minutes:** 

- First, Person A follows the instructions in Part 1 of the notebook. 
- Then, Person B follows the instructions in Part 2 of the notebook. 
- Finally, discuss and answer the questions at the bottom.
