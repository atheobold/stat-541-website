# Creating Maps

Maps are fantastic and complicated all at the same time! Maps are some of the
richest visualizations around because they come with data built into them. That 
is, on top of whatever data you're going to plot you are also probably going to
view terrain, roads, state/country borders, city names or a host of other
information that come with our geography.

This implicit richness only adds to challenge of creating a good map. Observe
the following recent tweet for a silly example of how maps can be...difficult. 

There is no shortage of map data visualizations on the web, but all too
often this is what we end up with:

# Check-in: `leaflet`

**1. Is running just the `leaflet()` function enough to produce a map?**

-   Yes
-   No

**2. To plot data points on a leaflet map, we should probably use which function?**

-   `addTiles()`
-   `addMarkers()`
-   `addProviderTiles()`
-   `addPolygons()`

## More on the `leaflet` package

The leaflet package is actually extremely rich and can basically enable
(interactive) map visualizations as complex as you can imagine. Take some time 
to peruse the site for the leaflet R package:

# Check-in: `leaflet`

**3.  What do the names of your plotted data columns have to be?**

-   `x`; `y`
-   `leafletx`; \`leaflety
-   `lat` / `latitude`; `lon`/ `longitude`
-   Anything as long as you tell the `addMarkers()` function correctly

**4.  If you were to think of latitude and longitude as coordinates in the
cartesian coordinate system, then...**

-   latitude is on the horizontal axis and longitude is on the vertical
-   latitude is on the vertical axis and longitude is on the horizontal

## Practice With Leaflet

```{r}
#| label: space-data

space <- read_csv(here::here("unit-1", 
                             "data",
                             "space.csv")
                  )
```

```{r}
#| label: map-of-astronauts
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: true

helmet_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "http://www.clker.com/cliparts/l/R/b/J/X/D/astronaut-helmet-md.png",
  iconWidth = 15, 
  iconHeight = 15
  )

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = jitter(space$Longitude, 
                          factor = 2), 
             lat = jitter(space$Latitude,
                          factor = 2), 
             icon = helmet_icon, 
             popup = paste(space$Name, "<br>", 
                           "Birth Place: ", space$`Birth Place`),
             label = paste(space$Name)
             )
```

# Check-in: `leaflet`

The above map plots data on NASA astronauts!

**5.  The graphic for each marker is a little astronaut helmet. How cute! This image was used via...**

-   a URL pointing to it on the web.
-   a downloaded image file.

**6.  The `popup` argument specifies what you see when you \_\_\_\_\_\_, while the `label` argument specifies what you see when you \_\_\_\_\_\_.**

-   hover; click
-   zoom-in; zoom-out
-   click; hover
-   squint your eyes; look normally
