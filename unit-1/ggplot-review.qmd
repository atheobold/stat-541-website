This module consists of readings reviewing material typically taught in STAT
331. It is possible you can skip over portions of this reading. It is your
responsibility to decide which areas you need to review before diving into
Stat 541.

# The Grammar of Graphics

You should feel comfortable with:

-   Knowing what goes into an aesthetic (`aes()`) versus the geometry (`geom_*()`)

-   Identifying these elements of existing plots

## Check-in: `ggplot` Review

Identify the elements of the following plot as

(i) An aesthetic
(ii) A geometry
(iii) A scale
(iv) None of the above

![](images/escalators.png)

(a) The x-axis is age
(b) The y-axis is "Urge to run up the down escalator"
(c) The y-axis ranges from "Weak" to "Strong"
(d) This is a line graph
(e) The two lines are "What I was supposed to feel" and "What I've actually felt"
(f) The lines are labeled with text
(g) Only even ages are labelled
(h) Stick figure people are sliding down the line

# Using ggplot2

You should be comfortable with:

-   using the "big 5" geometries

-   changing optional arguments.

-   faceting

## Checkin: `ggplot` Review

Fill in the six (6) blanks to make the following plot:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| label: ggplot-plot-code

starwars %>%
  ____(species == "Human") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(____ = height, y = mass, ____ = gender)) + 
  geom_[____](____ = 17) +
  ____(x = "Height (cm)", 
       y = "Mass (kg)", 
       color = "Gender Expression"
       )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: ggplot-plot

starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point(pch = 17) +
  labs(x = "Height (cm)", 
       y = "Mass (kg)", 
       color = "Gender Expression"
       )
```
