Now that we've acquired some skills for making dashboards, let's spice them up
a bit! This week, we're going to add interactive content to our dashboards!

This week is different from the previous weeks in that you get to choose which 
tool you want to explore when creating interactive content on your dashboard. 
There are two options:

1. Shiny
2. webR (and Observable JavaScript)

Either tool will allow you to make interactive content, but the way that you 
go about making the content differs (pretty substantially). Since you may not 
have heard about or explored either of these tools I would strongly recommend
poking around the resources below before making your decision!
