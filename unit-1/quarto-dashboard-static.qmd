title: "Quarto Dashboards, Part 1"

---

This week, we're taking the visualization skills we learned last week and using
them to create an informational dashboard. Quarto dashboards were integrated
into version 1.4, so you can use a familiar tool to create these dashboards. 
In part 1, we will focus on creating "static" dashboards---where the user 
**does not** interact with the content.
