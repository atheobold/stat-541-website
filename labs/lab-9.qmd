This lab is individual, but you are still encouraged to work and discuss with your peers.

For this lab, you will submit two pieces of art:

- One piece must be made using ordinary plotting functions on data. (similar
to the art made in the first reading)
- One piece must be completely generative. You may use packages from the
readings for this, but of course, do not simply turn in the default results of
a single function. :)

Both art pieces must also include:

- A title
- A museum-style description. Feel free to be overly dramatic with this, if you want to - it doesn't need to involve any true art theory.
- A description of the code choices and how they influenced the appearance of
the piece. For example, you might say, "By setting the number of recursions to
100, we repeat the pattern 100 times in the space of the image."
