In this first unit, we will explore various tools for communicating statistical
ideas. We will start with data visualizations, expanding your repertoire of 
tools for visualizing data. From there, we will move to dashboards---both 
static and dynamic. Finally, we will play with methods for including executable
R code inside these documents. 

Throughout these sections, you will encounter "check-ins" assessing your 
knowledge on a particular topic. These check-ins are delineated by a red 
(important) callout box and are associated with the Canvas quizzes assigned 
each week.

## Example Check-in Callout

This is where you will find the body of the question. The callout name refers
to the name of the Canvas quiz the question is associated with.
