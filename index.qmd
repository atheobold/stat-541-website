Stat 541 takes a deeper dive into statistical computing in R, building your 
*communication* and *iteration* skills. We will explore different modalities for
communicating statistical ideas---dynamic visualizations and dashboards, 
while also exploring ways to integrate R code into these environments. We will 
also continue to expand your skills as a developer---writing functions and
iterating over those functions to query data from APIs and scrape the web. We're
going to have a lot of fun!

## Acknowledements {.unnumbered}

A huge shout out to [Dr. Kelly Bodwin](http://kelly-bodwin.com/) for creating 
this class and adding it to the amazing number of computing courses the
Statistics Department teaches. Another shout out goes the the amazing women at
Macalester College---[Leslie Myint](https://www.lesliemyint.org/), [Brianna Heggeseth](https://bcheggeseth.github.io/), and [Alicia Johnson](https://ajohns24.github.io/)---for making their
*Intermediate Data Science* course materials public. And finally, a massive 
thank you to [Sam Shanny-Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/) for their
**incredible** resources for making and styling Quarto websites!

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), the lovely icons are
all by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/), and none of this would be
possible without the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).
