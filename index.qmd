Stat 541 takes a deeper dive into statistical computing in R, building your 
*communication* and *iteration* skills. We will explore different modalities for
communicating statistical ideas---dynamic visualizations and dashboards, 
while also exploring ways to integrate R code into these environments. We will 
also continue to expand your skills as a developer---writing functions and
iterating over those functions to query data from APIs and scrape the web. We're
going to have a lot of fun!

## Acknowledements {.unnumbered}

A huge shout out to Dr. Bodwin for creating this class and adding it to the 
amazing number of computing courses the Statistics Department teaches. Another
shout out goes the the amazing women at Macalester College---Leslie Myint,
Brianna Heggeseth, Alicia Johnson---for making their *Intermediate Data Science*
course materials public.
