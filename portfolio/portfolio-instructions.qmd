GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It
also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your
own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe
yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use
[resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of
your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

The development of Quarto has made it incredibly simple to 
[generate websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which can be easily 
hosted by GitHub Pages. 

## Instructions for Creating a Personal Website

If you've never made a personal website, you will need to create one! There are
**so** many resources for creating Quarto websites, but my absolute favorite 
one's are from Sam Csik

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `<your-username>.github.io` (replacing
"<your-username>" with your GitHub username). Initialize this repo with a 
`readme.md` file (one of the options when making the repo).

2. Create a new folder where you will store your personal website.

I would strongly recommend this folder living *inside* your broader "STAT 541"
folder, at least for now!

3. 

3. Use RStudio to create a new project inside the folder you created in Step 1.
Select "Quarto Website" as the project type.

4. Follow the Quick Start instructions on <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html> to create your website (or a generic site at <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>).

5. For publishing your website, follow the steps described under [Github Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

# .nojekyll

Be sure to follow the instructions for adding a text file named `.nojekyll` to
your project. This tells GitHub not to build the pages with Jekyll (another
rendering engine) and instead render pages built with Quarto.
